The recursive nature of State Committees enables them to ensure continuous proof validity and cross-chain relaying.\n\nSimilarly to Lagrange’s ZK Coprocessor, even in the case of a 2/3 stake attack toward the Prover network, ZK-state proof generation is not affected; only slight liveness issues may occur.\n\n*Being structured as a pure ZK system, Lagrange State Committees are extremely airtight toward potential safety exploits.\n\nDegree of decentralization in the sequencer and the overall Prover network are unknown.*",
